This is the repository for the third homework assignment in CS1660 Fall 2020 class. I have spent literally 20 hours trying to get the code to run on GCP to no avail. I posted on the discussion board about the issues I was encountering; even though 3 others responded with similar issues, there was no response or guidance. I could have easily finished all of the work I have due this week had there been explicit instructions. I figured that in a class title "Intro to Cloud Computing," we would be taught cloud computing basics and be given instructions on our assignments so we aren't blindly googling for hours on end trying to figure out what exactly is being asked in the assignment. I know for a fact that I and multiple others have been having issues working through the assignments because of vague instructions. It's absolutely ridiculous that I haven't been able to apply anything that I have "learned" in this class when we are over halfway through the semester. This is my senior year, and I am overloaded with working on my capstone project while also juggling other difficult classes. The fact that I have spent so much time on these small homework assignments for you to say that we should know what we are doing is insulting. This class has become a detriment to my mental health because I am constantly stressed about trying to get all of my other work done. No other class uses up this much time out of my week for what should be a straightforward and simple assignment.
